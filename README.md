# LIBRARY-MANAGEMENT-ENCAPSULATION-OOPS
This project is a Java-based Library Management System with three classes: `Library`, `Book`, and `Libmain`. The `Library` class manages library details and displays book information. The `Book` class handles book attributes like title, author, and ISBN. The `Libmain` class demonstrates the interaction between these classes.
